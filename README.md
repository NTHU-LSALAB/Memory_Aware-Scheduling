# Heterogeneous scheduling with memory constraints

## Usage

```
pip install matplotlib numpy
python main.py
```

Modify `main.py` to adopt different algorithm to see different results.

Fragmentation Case
- Run `sample.3.json` with memory 90 and 85
- You will see using 85 actually results in shorter execution
- The reason is that node 2, 3's memory allocation is better with 85 memory
